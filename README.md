# Smart-calculator
Smart calculator project from JetBrains Academy Python Core

About
Calculators are a very helpful tool that we all use on a regular basis. 
Why not create one yourself, and make it really special? In this project, you will write a calculator that not only adds, subtracts, and multiplies, but is also smart enough to remember your previous calculations.

Learning outcomes
Apart from writing a useful program (everyone uses calculators!), you will learn a lot about lists, strings and dictionaries. You will also get closer experience with 2 important data structures: the stack and the queue.
This project is a part of the following track

Python Core

What you’ll do and what you’ll learn
1. Your calculator is taking its first steps: teach it to calculate the sum of two integers and display the result on the screen.
2. Enable your calculator to keep adding numbers in a loop until the user enters “exit”.
3. Using lists and strings, make it possible to calculate sums of multiple integers.
4. Where there is a plus, there is a minus. Using your knowledge of lists and strings, enable the calculator to deal with subtraction as well as addition.
5. There’s no math without errors: teach your program to alert the user to errors in the case of invalid input.
6. Working with dict, enable the calculator to use variables.
7. Time to upgrade and add even more possible operations: multiplication, division, powers, and calculations in parentheses.
